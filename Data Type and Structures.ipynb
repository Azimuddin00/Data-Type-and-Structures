Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","\n","   **Ans>>**\n","   \n","   Historically (before Python 3.7), dictionaries were considered unordered because the order in which key-value pairs were inserted was not guaranteed to be preserved when you iterated through the dictionary or printed it. The internal storage mechanism (hash table) optimized for fast lookups, not for maintaining insertion order.\n","\n","   Since Python 3.7, dictionaries in standard Python implementation (CPython) remember the insertion order of items. This means that when you iterate through a dictionary, the key-value pairs will be returned in the order they were originally added.\n","\n","   How it affects data retrieval -\n","\n","   - Historically (unordered): Because the order was not guaranteed, you could not rely on the sequence of items when iterating through a dictionary.

Data retrieval was primarily based on the key, not on the position or insertion order.\n","\n","   - Currently (ordered by insertion): While dictionaries now maintain insertion order, their primary strength for data retrieval still lies in key-based access.
